    "text": "“The relationship between teacher and student is…different from what it was in the past. The former is no longer there for the sake of the latter; both are there for the sake of Wissenschaft [Science]”\n–Wilhelm von Humboldt\n\n\nWhether we are studying Anatomy and Physiology, Evolution, or Bioinformatics, we will be addressing a wide range of important questions. Examining such challenging questions is sometimes difficult, but it becomes easier when we work together. I strongly believe students and teachers can most effectively engage with science in an environment where all students bring 100% of themselves to the classroom: their identities, values, motivations, goals, and experiences. In the pursuit of creating a space where this can be achieved, the following values1 inspire the classroom I hope to create:\nHumanity: We approach science as complete individuals with a range of experiences and perspectives. When we enter a classroom, we enter as the product of our lived experiences, communities, values, and identity. These experiences are valued by all members of our classroom community.\nHumility: By its nature, science is rooted in the appreciation of what we don’t know. None of us are perfect, and the classroom is a space where we can make mistakes. On my end, I will do my best to meet my students where they are, provide the help I can give, and demonstrate patience. On your end, I would like you to feel empowered to support each other, and ask for help when needed.\nCommunication: Teaching is rooted in communication and dialogue. I have found, both as a learner and a teacher, that by talking about lecture material with a friend or putting it in writing, the challenge becomes easier. This is why we have classrooms: to communicate! I will be as communicative as possible as a lecturer, but for our classroom to succeed, you also need to communicate. Answer questions, ask questions, and come to office hours to work through your understanding of the topics.\n\n\n\nReducing a person’s accomplishments and knowledge to a letter grade cannot capture their experiences in a classroom. However, I also am providing a service to Stonehill College and the scientific community as a whole, and part of that service is giving you a letter grade. I ask that you respect the grading structure given in the syllabus. In return, I intend to approach grading in the spirit of humility, and am happy to have open dialogue on how to most effectively grade.\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, the resources provided by AI tools such as ChatGPT, while useful, run against the values of my classroom (as AI models do not approach learning in the spirit of humanity, humility, or communication). Please do not use AI tools as teachers or “Cliffsnotes”. It may make your problem “feel” easier, but it won’t lead to lasting knowledge. Please respect the AI policy of any given class. If you believe the tools provided by an AI resource will help you more effectively engage with an assignment or the classroom, contact me and we will talk."

    "title": "Pluribus is about AI, right?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article contains spoilers for the first two episodes of “Pluribus”\nForgive the title. I generally hate reductive “A is actually about B” arguments; they diminish rather than expand artistic interpretation in order to give dorks a way to gatekeep art from others. But, I must lick the donut of the internet with the spittle of my thoughts1: “Pluribus” is about AI, right?\nThe central tension, to me, when examining hiveminds (both in fiction and in real life!) is disentangling the role of the individual and the collective. What is gained from collectivizing all human experience and knowledge, and what is lost? When the individual is eaten away, you get The Borg; when individuality shines through, you get something like Janet. The first episode, quite wisely, keeps these answers close to its chest2.\nThe second episode makes a really brilliant choice as it begins to tease out the nature of The Pluribus3, by focusing the tension not on Helen, but on 5 unturned people who are far more sympathetic to The Pluribus’ mission. This allows us to, for a brief moment, consider The Pluribus from the way they want to be seen. Of course, this sympathetic perspective will never go unchallenged by Helen4, but it is far more interesting than having every word Pluribus says treated with complete disdain.\nThese conversations reveal that The Pluribus is somewhere between The Borg and Janet. They collective seems to care about the veneer of individuality: they appreciate the gravity of the fact that Zosia can only be one place at a time, and are able to attribute their knowledge to individual sources — but there also clearly is a master code which is overriding some aspects of this collective (do not kill, do not cause negative emotions).\nKoumba’s reaction reveals the priorities of this master code. The Pluribus are entirely “peaceful”. As the survivors begin to dissect that directive — what about wasps? bugs? — Koumba comes up with the perfect loophole. While The Pluribus will not kill for Koumba, if he provided the meat, Pluribus would cross the line with him. Compare to the ‘art’ of prompt engineering in ChatGPT: with the proper language, there is no “master code” or ethical standard which cannot be broken. This is because ChatGPT isn’t an ethics engine – it exists to predict text with maximal efficiency. Cause a divorce, sell a kidney, perform a lobotomy, it’s all just words, nothing behind them. The Pluribus cannot truly have an ethical standard, as ethics would run contrary to its greater objective: give Koumba exactly what he wants.\nBut, of course, The Pluribus cannot always give the survivors exactly what they want. Laxmi will never get her son Ravi back. Yet, you wouldn’t know it from how she talks to Pluribus-Ravi. While almost impossible for Helen to imagine, this desire for connection is deeply human: Adam Becker terms the connection people form with ChatGPT uses as a form of “digital pareidolia”: seeing faces where there is none (Becker 2025). Who can blame Laxmi for forming that same connection with her joined son? Ironically, the show seems to imply that Helen’s curmudgeonliness and lack of tether to the rest of humanity is why she is unable to connect with The Pluribus’ attempts to put her at ease – you can’t see faces when you aren’t looking for them.\nOf course, the tragedy in both cases is that The Pluribus’ only real biological imperative is to join. Their goal to give you “exactly what you want” is simply the easiest way to do it: it’s a lot easier to convert others and avoid detection if you are acting like you are providing a service rather than going to war…so long as going to war isn’t the most effective option. Once it is, 886 million people doesn’t seem like a particularly large number. Just as AI companies, in pursuit of profit and power, will sell you a dream that you fill in the blanks to fulfill, The Pluribus seems to want to make the humans as happy as they can while they figure out how to finish their biological imperative. That may be a genuine and earnest desire — but it is still one that runs against humanity.\nAnd it is with all this in mind I must imagine Vince Gilligan — a man who loathes AI with the passion of a true hater — wrote and directed Pluribus with AI in mind. Obviously, this doesn’t mean Pluribus is “about” AI; no one show is about one thing, and clearly many aspects of Pluribus were envisioned well before the present AI moment. But I think these articles which conclude Pluribus isn’t a metaphor for artificial intelligence are missing the point. Pluribus might not be a direct one-to-one metaphor. However, Pluribus is clearly a show about humanity and why it is worth fighting for even when the alternative promises the world. And in the present moment, I can’t imagine a better way to tell a story about AI."

The reason for this is pragmatism and equity. Pragmatically, once the final exam is done, most students want to enjoy their holiday. If I give you an extra credit assignment, I’d have to give this to not just you, but all other students, which I would need to expect them to do over the holiday3. And frankly, I think it is better to enjoy your break, spend time with your family and recharge. In turn, I don’t feel comfortable giving only the students who ask for extra credit an assignment, as I want to make sure all students have an equal opportunity to boost their grades. I try to address this gap by giving extra credit assignments during the semester, but after the semester, it just does not work pragmatically."

    "text": "Argument 2: Nonrepresentative Grades\n“Grading is arbitrary anyways. If you look at my work, you’ll see I did better on assignments XYZ, which were more relevant, and most of my mistakes were due to silly blunders irrelevant to the learning goals.”\nThis is the argument that gets me the most, because it often is true. I very frequently see a student who I find brilliant get a less than perfect grade for arbitrary reasons. It is important that those students know how proud I am of their development, but changing the grade doesn’t help that. Grading is a poor metric student success, however, I consider grading my responsibility to Stonehill and the scientific community. That responsibility is not to grade perfectly, but to grade fairly. I owe it to my students to grade how I said I would grade, and I owe it to the scientific community that my grading system is as unbiased as possible. I try to grade in the spirit of humility: making sure the scheme is not just fair but encourages student success and doesn’t punish students arbitrarily for small nits. But finding a “perfect grading scheme” is a lifelong process, and not one that is solved by changing your grade post-hoc."

However, I believe it will always be more important professionally to focus on the big picture, and not dwell on smaller things. College is a marathon, and resilience is key to not burning out. This is significantly more important than any individual grade in any individual class. So while a better grade may help you win the battle, dwelling on the smaller picture will absolutely make it harder for to win the war."

    "text": "I. An Aside: AI is Many Different Things\nA big part of the success of the ‘hype’ cycle with regard to AI is its ability to leverage many different technologies and lump them in one more easily marketable category.  Many of these tools have existed for years: deep-learning methods in computer vision have been a massive part of the last two decades of the field (Chai et al. 2021). \nWhen we develop AI policy, we really are developing policies on many different technologies.  Some of these technologies can do a lot of good!  For instance, when properly used, Github Copilot makes workflows far more efficient and accessible (especially when compared to the previous technique, obsessively searching Stackoverflow).\nI think it is important to be specific and clear with regard to what AI tools we are referring to. LLM-based generative AI is definitely the style of AI that students are most familiar with, but I have encountered many students who do not realize that Grammarly is a rooted in generative AI (Palmer 2024). Being as specific as possible is critical so that students don’t accidentally get in trouble for using the wrong tool, and for that, we as educators need to try to stay at the forefront of developments in AI. I’ve found this to be a topic by students are absolutely jazzed to discuss with me, as it is as complicated to them as it is to me."

    "text": "II. Playing Hangman with AI\nDuring one of the presentations at the seminar, our speaker asked us to write both an AI policy and the values that inform this policy. I love this idea, and I think this should be the case with all class policies, not just AI! My issue was the values she associated with prohibiting AI in the classroom were ‘rigor’ and ‘fairness’. I thought that was a foolish simplification, because I don’t find that to be why I prohibit AI in my classroom at all.\nWhile I do consider AI to be discriminatory and unethical (much of my thoughts have been informed by (Becker 2025) and (Hao 2025)), even if that weren’t the case and a truly equitable amount of environmentally-friendly legally-obtained training data were found, I still wouldn’t want generative AI in my classroom. This is because generative AI, as a tool, is designed to give you exactly what you ask it, or at least successfully create the feeling that it gave you what you asked it.  The analogy I’ve always liked giving is playing a game of hangman against ChatGPT.  Ask ChatGPT to give you a word and play hangman with you, and you can give letters and ChatGPT will fill in the blanks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it works well!  You’re playing hangman!  Until you get to the end:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is, fine, to an extent. ChatGPT isn’t a hangman playing computer, and I usually don’t want to play hangman. But ChatGPT cannot say “no, this is beyond my capabilities”.  Even Google is able to say “I have found 0 search results”. If someone just wants to ‘bang out’ a document that they don’t care about, this is fine (though I do encourage my students to be thoughtful about what you care about).  But I don’t think education is about just giving a product."

Growth Mindsets\nCollege is expensive, disgustingly expensive.  I believe this prohibitive cost has led some students to see college as an exchange: “I give you exams/papers/psets, you give me a passing grade so I can get a diploma”. While I understand that some students (and teachers!) see it that way, I think that is not a productive way to think about education.  First, the exchange ratio is off: as a professor on Bluesky put it (wish I saved the comment!) I have enough exams/papers/psets; I don’t need more.  \nI hope that students in my class think of any challenge they encounter in my class like weightlifting. You could bring a forklift to the gym, but it’s not about lifting the heaviest weight. It’s about the strategies you develop and the muscles you build to overcome the obstacle. Part of that means not being able to lift the weight immediately. If you use a tool like ChatGPT that will always “give you what you want”, you won’t gain those skills.  \nAnd even if you never take another biology class in your life, I hope you take on challenges that are truly Yours: whether that’s researching the answers to previously unasked questions, creating art that best represents your style, or figuring out how to become the best version of yourself with the people you love. And as you take on those challenges, you won’t be able to rely on tools which give you exactly what you ask for 100% of the time, because those answers are either unknown, or can only come from within. That is why you come to college, so we can work together to develop the skills to address whatever those challenges may be. Not to play hangman for four years with AI."

    "text": "I. At Half-Staff\nCharlie Kirk advocated for a country that many of my students would not be welcome in. He advocated for citizen forces to preserve “white demographics” and repeatedly stoked fears and doubt of the ethics and capabilities of non-white Americans. For instance, he uncritically parroted the statistic “by age of 23, half of all Black males have been arrested and not enough of them have been arrested.”(Bouie 2025)1. He was similarly doubtful of the abilities of black leaders, accusing them of “not having the brain processing power to be taken really seriously”(McNamara and McMenamin 2025). As a teacher, I am honored to work with talented students of color who aspire to take on lines of work far beyond my abilities; when I see the flag at half-staff, I think of my students.\nCharlie Kirk advocated for a country that my loved ones would not be welcome in. I am non-binary, and have been blessed with trans people who have had their lives dramatically bettered through gender-affirming medical care. Kirk called for a “Nuremberg-style trial for every gender-affirming clinic doctor” (McNamara and McMenamin 2025), and referred to trans and non-binary folks like me as “a throbbing middle finger to God” (Perry 2025). My community and I have been blessed that Stonehill has provided a space where I can live my truest and best life; when I see the flag at half-staff, I think of my community.\nDespite frequently touring college campuses, Charlie Kirk actively silenced the speech essential to the academic mission. His Mccarthyite Professor Watchlist was a blatant attempt to intimidate and harass professors for their speech (Bouie 2025). It is not surprising that the Watchlist primarily targeted researchers of color and queer researchers, often for the sin of teaching about vaccination, race or that queer people exist. While I don’t agree with every professor on the watchlist, a university depends on the ability of academics to voice their opinion without fear of retaliation. Otherwise, it becomes the echo chamber he claimed to be fighting against. I’ve been grateful that, at Stonehill, I get to work with this broad array of academics across ideological and political lines to answer truly difficult questions; when I see the flag at half-staff, I think of my calling.\nIn my time here, I’ve had an admiration for how earnestly professors and administrators look to Stonehill’s mission statement for guidance. Stonehill values “fostering a culture where differences are affirmed and anchored by a belief in the inherent dignity of each person”, and encourages students to act and lead “with courage to create a more just and compassionate world.” When the folks who chose to fly the flag at half-staff reflect on this decision, I hope they think about what those words mean2."

    "text": "Prior to working as a Professor at Stonehill, I completed my Ph.D. at Princeton University with Dr. Sarah Kocher. My dissertation is on the collective behavior of bees, at both the individual-level and the colony-level.\nOver the time, I have learned a great deal on raising bumblebees, insect biology, mathematical modeling, and developing bioinformatics pipelines to understand social behavior. I am always excited to talk science, and I love collaboration! I am especially excited to chat with Stonehill students who are looking to develop skills in data visualization, programming, or biological modeling, or who are working on a project where utilizing these skills will be useful.\nMy other passion has been developing my skills as an educator. I have a deep passion for teaching incarcerated students, working as an educator and course coordinator for the Prison Teaching Initiative in New Jersey. If you are interested in working with incarcerated students, get in touch!\nWhether you’re a student, a bee biologist, or an educator, I hope the resources I provide on this site can be helpful!\nMy CV"
